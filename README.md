# Analyze-A-B-Test

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

I used regression models to answer this questions.

You can find the whole project in the Jupyter Notebook. I also added a html file of the project since it is difficult to see diffs on notebooks and do code reviews
